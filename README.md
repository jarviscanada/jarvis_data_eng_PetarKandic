# Petar Kandic . Jarvis Consulting

I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience developing applications. Throughout my professional and personal experience, I have gained a significant understanding of languages such as Java and C, as well as commonly used technologies, including Linux and Git. While back-end development is my greatest strength, I also have experience designing websites, utilizing HTML/CSS. I have worked alone and as part of a team, accomplishing goals alongside my coworkers. Whenever new challenges arise, I am prepared to take them on, using what I have learned.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PetarKandic](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PetarKandic)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PetarKandic/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed two Bash scripts to monitor the status of a Linux system. These shell scripts are used to gather data on system memory and performance. The data is stored on a PostgreSQL database, hosted on a Docker container. The scripts are automatically run every minute, using a Crontab job. The bash -x command was used to test the scripts. By automating these tasks, time is saved over having to manually check the system's status.


## Highlighted Projects
**Tutoring Web Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/pkandic4/TutoringApplication)]: Designed a web tutoring application in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I used the WebStorm IDE to create and implement this application. I used HTML/CSS to create the static components, and JavaScript to construct the active elements. The log-in system uses SQL to store and retrieve the user's log-in info. The application displays a range of subjects for which tutors are available. I tested this application using Mocha; this experience led to improvements in the UI. The application runs on the local machine, and is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

**Java Car Dealership Simulator** [[GitHub](https://github.com/pkandic4/CarDealershipSimulator)]: Designed and programmed a car dealership simulator in Core Java. I used the IntelliJ IDE to develop and implement this application. The simulator enables the user to buy and return cars, as well as filter the car list based on factors such as make and price. I employed unit testing, and each command was extensively tested. The application runs on the local machine, and is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2023-present)**: Designing and programming applications in Bash and Java. I have developed Bash scripts to gather machine and usage data on Linux systems. These scripts interact with a PostgreSQL instance stored on a docker container to store data persistently. I used Vim to develop these scripts. The scripts were tested from the command line, using bash -x. During my time at Jarvis, I have worked with a team to reach our goals. Our team uses the Agile model, and we hold daily scrums, which allow us to understand our progress. These scrums allow us to understand our progress on different applications. With this understanding, we can assist each other as necessary.

**Data Engineer, Fiix Software (2021)**: Developed a web scraping application using Python (including the pandas and boto3 libraries) to gather the web usage data of our clients. This application was then deployed over AWS, and executed at regular intervals using cron. Before the deployment, I also used AWS to test the application on sample databases. The scraper executed 35% faster than its predecessor. This allowed the company to process data at a faster rate than before.
